## Hi there 👋
### 🔭 I’m currently working on developing a vocational education curriculum system. As a vocational college teacher specializing in engineering cost estimation and control, I combine BIM technology with traditional methodologies in training modules. 
### 🌱 I’m currently learning cutting-edge BIM and construction technologies on GitHub, applying them to enhance vocational education through collaborative digital projects.
### 🤔 I’m looking for help with dynamic classroom grouping algorithms and hands-on training frameworks to enhance collaborative learning efficiency through data-driven student pairing.
### 💬 Ask me about cost documentation techniques (estimates, budgets, settlements) and project management strategies for cost control in Chinese construction projects.
### 📫 How to reach me:[B站账号](https://space.bilibili.com/32095085)
